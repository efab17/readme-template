# Milestone Project 1: Digital CV

This User centric front-end project was completed as part of the full stack developer course with Code Institute. It was the first opportunity to showcase the technical skills and technologies I have learnt thus far. This front-end digital CV was created using HTML5 and CSS as well as Bootstrap libraries.

 
## UX
 
User Experience Design is the process of creating a product that is useful, usuable and provides value to the targeted user. It follows a process known as User Centered design. This process consists of 5 design planes that essentially perform as the 'make-up' of a valuable product.

### STRATEGY 
The aim of this project is to build an online portfolio that can be later updated as I strengthen my technical skills whilst on the course. Making a career switch, an online portfolio felt the most obvious place to start. This is being built with potential employers and recruiters in mind, as well as fellow developers that may want to collaborate on future projects. My strategy is to market myself and showcase my skills building a product that is useful, valuable, responsive and follows the mobile first design approach.
My intention is to build a product that has a clean,classic and professional aesthetic.

### SCOPE
User Stories:
* As an employer or recruiter, a key point of intrest would be the skills and technologies the devloper possess, previous work the developer has completed, as well as educational background information and possibly a traditonal CV with contact information.
* As a future collaborator my main focus would be to grasp a feel for the devlopers creativity, a showcase of the projects they've worked on and contact details to get in touch.
* As a client my main intrests are previous work completed by the developer, contact details and possible testimonials from previous clients that can vouch for the developers customer service etc. 

### STRUCTURE
I want the structure of this product to be as simiple as possible but still effective. I have identified 5 key pages that I feel will best relay the information necessary.
* Home - This is the first page the user encounters with a brief introduction to what the product is and navigation links to other pages as well as social links.
* About - The About page holds Information regarding the devloper, work experience, possibly educational background and skillset.
* Projects - The project page includes the most recent work of the developer.
* Contact- The contact page will consist of a form that will stimulate a call to action.
* Download- This will be a link to a pdf of the devlopers traditonal CV.

Here is a site map of the product:

### SKELETON
To continue with the planning process, wireframes were created of each page to get a basic feel of the layout and elements featured. Using a software called Balsamiq, suggested by Code Institute, low-fidelity mock-ups were generated to include wiresframes of each page across three different devices.
These wireframes will help visulaise how different features would appear on different screen sizes before implementing any code.

* ABOUT PAGE link
* PROJECTS PAGE link 
* CONTACT PAGE link

### SURFACE
The surface plane is the final plane of user centered design and focuses on the look of the product.
#### Colour scheme
As previously mentioned, I wanted the product to have a clean, simple and professional aesthetic. To achieve this, I decided to keep the colour scheme as minimal as possible using only three colours.
* Rich Black (#0A0A0A) - This colour was used as the background colour for all pages.
* White (#FAFAFA) - This colour was used mainly for text, certain headings and navigation links.
* Light Steel Blue (#AABDD0) - This colour was used as an accent colour for borders, as well as certain headings and buttons.

#### Typography
For the sake of simplicity and to allow for a cohesive product, I decided to use Cabin across the whole site, with some differentiation in text transform. In the case Cabin was not accessible, sans serif was set as a fall back font.
#### Imagery
Images are important to capture users and keep them engaged. To personalise the product, the logo image allows the user to know the developer without meeting them. Images can be also seen in the cards on projects page. Minimal imagery adds to the aesthetic of the site.

## Features
Here are the features that appear in the site.

### Existing Features
- Navigation bar - Implemented using Bootstrap, Allows the user to navigate through the site and appears on every page. 
- Footer - This appears on every page and includes a short statement about the site, a download link to a traditional CV and social links.
- Progress bar - Implemented using Bootstrap, this appears on the 'about' page in the skills section.
- Cards - Cards with image-tops appear on the projects page for a visual aid to each project. This was implemented using Bootstrap.
- Contact form - A form appears on the contact page, implemented using Bootstrap, to evoke a call to action.



## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com)
    - This software was used to create wireframes of the proposed pages of the site.
- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
   - This is the main language used to create the site.
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
   - This is the main language used to style the site.
- [GitHub](https://github.com)
   - This is a platform used by all developers and a directory to store code that was been pushed from GitPod.
- [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/)
  - This is an online editor used to create and edit code.
- [Bootstrap v4.5](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  - This is a framework library that consists of pre-written code, and is used to assist in the creation of responsive web development.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) 
  - This is used to import Typography.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)
  - This is used to add icons to the code


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
